This is a ML Diamond Price Predictor model, which I then implemented into a interactive GUI program using Python and Tkinter.
Attatched in this repository are three files.
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) — Contains the full model training and evaluation process.
2. XGB Model (.pkl) — The trained XGBoost model saved using pickle.
3. Python GUI Script (.py) — A Tkinter-based application that loads the model and allows users to input diamond features to predict prices interactively.
